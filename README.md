## Known Bugs or Limitations

- **Responsive UI Scaling:** Some UI elements (like chart labels or suggestion text) may not always adjust perfectly when resizing the window to very large dimensions.
- **No Password Reset:** There is no feature to reset or change a userâ€™s password after registration.
- **No Input Sanitization for Descriptions:** Special characters in transaction descriptions are stored as-is.
- **No Recurring Transactions:** BudgetFlow currently does not support recurring expense/saving entries (e.g., monthly rent).
- **Single User Session:** The app supports one user login at a time and does not support multiple concurrent sessions.
- **Form Field Persistence:** After navigating from login to register and back, the previously entered username/password fields are not cleared. This may lead to confusion or unintended data being submitted.
